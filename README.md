# leryon-with-php
Leryon was still developed with PHP until the end of 2020. Since the beginning of 2020 we are rewriting the entire source code in NodeJS and Python. Since we are no longer developing Leryon in PHP, we have decided to develop a Leryon PHP version, as we want to continue to push PHP.

The current source code is an older version from 2019!
